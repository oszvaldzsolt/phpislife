.::How to make a forum::.

.:The beginning of time:.

First step, we learn when we use. This tutorial supposes that you know how to program. I guess I am a noob in php as well as you, so let's get started.

I am planning to make a sign in platform, with a sign up option.

First we make the simple sign in part.

1. I needed to look up how to redirect the page, to our will-be home page. 
header('Location: tothissite.html'); is the way to do it.

2. I am unable to coerce the condition $_POST['name'] == "Zsolt" work. Maybe there is a different way to do things.

3. Of course because PHP is not natively supported by the OS. I need to fire up my local XAMPP...

It finally works!

.:Database is a must:.

I will use mysql.

http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ is the default address for access in the case of XAMPP.

Make a new database with the name testveriseg.

I will use utf8_hungarian_ci as my default character set.

Make a table "users". It will contain the name, and password pairs. Make name column primary! Add btree type index for name.

.:Connecting to the database:.

There are two options:
-MySQLi extension (the "i" stands for improved)
-PDO (PHP Data Objects)

Because PDO is more flexible I choose that.

Add a new user to the table in phpmyadmin.

Connection is established. The problem with this approach, is that the connection string contains the name and the password. In Apache web server the "good way to go" is to make different folders. A public and private ones, and the private ones should be accessed by Apache only. 

.:The work continues:.

Long time no see, let's continue the work. First, by fixing signup page.

The page refuses to save the data to mysql. I need to investigate what is the reason.

I have no idea why it doesn't work. I try to learn laravel, so in future i can develop quicker.

Before I began I found out, that the form was bad. The names for the password, and retyped password were wrongfully given.
