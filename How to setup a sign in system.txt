.::How to make a forum::.

.:The beginning of time:.

First step, we learn when we use. This tutorial supposes that you know how to program. I guess I am a noob in php as well as you, so let's get started.

I am planning to make a sign in platform, with a sign up option.

First we make the simple sign in part.

1. I needed to look up how to redirect the page, to our will-be home page. 
header('Location: tothissite.html'); is the way to do it.

2. I am unable to coerce the condition $_POST['name'] == "Zsolt" work. Maybe there is a different way to do things.

3. Of course because PHP is not natively supported by the OS. I need to fire up my local XAMPP...

It finally works!

.:Database is a must:.

I will use mysql.

http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ is the default address for access in the case of XAMPP.

Make a new database with the name testveriseg.

I will use utf8_hungarian_ci as my default character set.

Make a table "users". It will contain the name, and password pairs. Make name column unique! Add btree type index for name.
